- This is part 1 for an application to remind myself of how to utilize these technologies. Pay no heed to this repo.

This app will go through creating a SpringBoot application with Jenkins as you can tell by the name.
Furthermore, in part 2, it will go into wrapping the app into a docker image, building with jenkins, and then pushing it to 
docker hub. Finally, in part 3, this dockerized container will be then deployed to AWS.
